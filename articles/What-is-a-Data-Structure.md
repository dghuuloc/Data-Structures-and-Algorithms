## Introduction to Data Structure?
The data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer system so that we can use the data easily.

Its main operations are given below:
1. `Searching` – The process of finding an element is called searching. There are two algorithms to complete the search, the first binary search and the second linear search.
2. `Sorting` – The process of arranging the data structure in a particular order is called sorting. There are many algorithms to perform sorting, such as – insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, radix sort, etc.
3. `Insertion` – The process of adding elements to a location is called insertion. If the size of a data structure is n, then we can insert only n-1 elements in it.
4. `Deletion` – The process of removing an element is called deletion. We can delete data from any location we want.
5. `Traversing` – Traversing means traversing each data structure element to perform a particular task.
6. `Merging` – Joining two such lists which have the same type of data elements together is called merging. From this, we get a third list.
