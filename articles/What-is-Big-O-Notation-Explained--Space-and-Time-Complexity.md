## What is Big O Notation?

__Big O__ is a notation that allows us to evaluate this, specifically it allows us to evaluate growth rates by analyzing how __time complexity__ (Time of execution) and __space complexity__ (memory usage) scale for a given algorithm when larger input sizes are processed by it. Big O is driven by the upper bound or higher complexity found in an algorithm so the worst case complexity will be the Big O representation of your code..

## Big-Oder of magnitude

A number of very common order of magnitude functions will come up over and over as you study algorithms.

| TERM    | BIG O NOTATION |
|--------------|:---------:|
| Constant  |  O(1)  |
| Linear  |  O(n)  |
| Logarithmic  |  O(log n)  |
| Linearithmic  |  O(n log n)  |
| Quadratic  |  O(n^2)  |
| Cubic  |  O(n^3)  |
| Exponential  |  O(2^n)  |
| Factorial  |  O(n!)  |


## Performance comparison

The chart below depicts the Big-O complexities mentioned above and the number of elements in the input against the number of operations. The color coding provides a rough judgement on their performance.

The table below shows just how big of a difference the number of computations between these-alogorithms are for 10, 100, and 1000 input elements:
